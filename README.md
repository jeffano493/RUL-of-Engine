### Description:
Accurately predicting the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of jet engines is crucial for optimizing maintenance and improving safety. Using the NASA C-MAPSS dataset, this project employs machine learning techniques and PCA to enhance predictive maintenance strategies. Results highlight critical factors affecting engine degradation and improve prediction accuracy.
